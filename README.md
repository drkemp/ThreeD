3D models for printing in plastic
=======
> Arduino Case

#Desription
- Stand-alone, but can use the Arduino library if you want to place the board for clearance.
- provides a case top & bottom with standoffs for Arduino and screw mounts
- front and back panels are flat and can easily be customized for holes

#Usage
By default will produce one half of a case 100mmx120mmx40mm with Arduino standoffs. You can just print two of these for a second half.
