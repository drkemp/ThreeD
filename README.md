3D models for printing in plastic

ArduinoCase
------------

#Description
This is a complete, 3D printable case for an Arduino Project. 
The case is made from a 4 parts:
- Identical top and bottom (except optional holes and standoffs)
- front panel (with holes)
- back panel (with holes)

Uses the Arduino model by jestin ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18139 ).
The file can be used stand-alone, but byt default uses the Arduino library so you can place the board for clearance checks.

If you dont want to use the Arduino library, comment out the library and dont include the Arduino.

#Usage
By default will produce one half of a case 100mmx120mmx40mm with Arduino standoffs. You can just print two of these for a second half.
The settings near the top of the file allow adjustment of all the basics:
- case overall size, corner radius
- material thickness
- board standoff height
- hole list for front and back panels
